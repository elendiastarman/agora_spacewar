		<h1>Agora code test &ndash; using the Spacewar! game</h1>
        
        <p>As I understand it, the problem is to design a system whereby individual users of a game are tracked, with gameplay statistics and achievements associated with them. The problem also asked that a developer be able to read, create, and update individual user records. However, I figured that in practice and in most situations, code would do the updating, not humans.
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Though the problem statement did not seem to require any functioning code at all, I chose to take the &ndash; perhaps &ndash; unusual tack of building a functioning demo in order to <em>show</em>, rather than merely talk about, my design of such a system. As such, this website is my document and it is <em>interactive</em>.
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Early on, I realized that in order to demonstrate such a system, I would have to have a good deal of data. In thinking about how to generate this data, I remembered that I had previously worked on a project where I cloned the classic Spacewar! game &ndash; one of the first video games ever &ndash; and ran a King-of-the-Hill contest where bots written by members of the Stack Exchange site Programming Puzzles and Code Golf competed. That is, I already had a game and many AI players, perfect for generating relatively realistic data.
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Thus, I used Javascript, jQuery, and D3.js for the front end and Python/Django for the backend, with Postgres as the database engine. The workflow goes like this:
        
        <ol>
            <li>Two bots (or humans) are selected to play a game.</li>
            <li>During the game, a number of different events are recorded, including round starts, player deaths, and firing missiles, to name a few, along with a couple selected attributes for each, including the frame that the event occurred on. Achievements are considered a type of event here.</li>
            <li>After the game ends, statistics are calculated for each round and the game as a whole.</li>
            <li>The raw event data and processed statistics, as well as the identities of the players, are sent to the server backend.</li>
            <li>The backend updates the database accordingly, creating records as needed.</li>
            <li>A few data-driven elements on the page are updated.</li>
        </ol>
        
        So, without further ado, I'd like to present the game Spacewar! below and encourage you to play at least one game. By default, the two players are a Red human and a Blue userbot. The userbot player uses the code in two text boxes below the playing field to make its decisions; it is effectively a way for people to test their AI bot. There are also a grid of choices for picking players and a small table below the playing field with the controls for human players for either side. Just click the screen to start the game.

        <p>
        Now, a few comments on my design and implementation of this system. First of all, I recognize that this system is fairly closely coupled with the game, though I tried to make them relatively independent. For instance, achievements are calculated by the game rather than the backend, which would make it easier to swap out Spacewar! for another game. This does mean, however, that if no game-independent information is sent to the client (such as prior player statistics), then achievements such as "win your first game" and "win five games in a row" must be calculated by the backend, which ties them more closely together. Hence, all of the potential achievements (<code>SELECT * FROM "agora_spacewar_achievementtemplate";</code>) are those that can be obtained within a single game (though only three of them are currently implemented: Weather the Storm, Dominator, and Executor). I presume that Hydra is built to communicate more and assume less, since that seems to be the most feasible way to support a few dozen games. The game-round structure is a natural fit for Spacewar!, but I don't expect that it would fit most other games quite so well. What might work though is to have a generic "block of time" model that can be made as large or small as appropriate for the situation.
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Second, I am unaware of any Postgres-specific features that are used by the backend, which means that it would take only a little time and effort to switch it over to MongoDB or Redis. I did not do so here due to time constraints, but I expect I could complete the transition in a few days or weeks. Likewise, though I use Django for both handling requests and creating objects in the database, I expect that Flask could be used for the former and psycopg2 for the latter, assuming that Postgres is the database engine used. (I already use psycopg2 to run user queries on the database.)
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Finally, again due to time constraints, I didn't flesh this system out fully. For instance, I had planned on implementing separate features for reading, creating, and updating specific rows so as to give developers a more direct tool for doing such tasks, instead of relying on a query-executing feature. Django and Postgres do both come with built-in command line utilities where you can perform such operations on the database, so while they might be inconvenient, at least the functionality exists. I don't feel that such an assumption would necessarily be valid for other database engines. I do think, however, that this system shown here has the necessary components for a viable and decent product, given more time to improve and polish each aspect of it.
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hoped you enjoyed playing the game Spacewar! All of the code for the frontend and backend can be found on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/elendiastarman/agora_spacewar">https://github.com/elendiastarman/agora_spacewar</a>
